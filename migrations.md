To update a database using Entity Framework from the command line (cmd), you typically use the **Entity Framework Core CLI** (Command-Line Interface). Here's how you can achieve this:

### Steps to Update a Database in Entity Framework Core:

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   Open a command prompt or terminal in the directory of your project where the `.csproj` file exists.

2. **Install Entity Framework Core Tools** (if you haven't installed it yet):
   If you're using .NET Core or .NET 5/6/7 and have not installed the tools yet, you can install them globally using:

   ```bash
   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
   ```

   Alternatively, you can install it locally in your project:

   ```bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
   ```

3. **Make Changes to Your Models/Entities**:
   Update your entity models and/or the `DbContext` class as needed.

4. **Create a Migration**:
   Run the following command to create a new migration that will capture the changes you made to your models:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
   ```

   Replace `<MigrationName>` with a meaningful name, e.g., `AddNewColumn`.

5. **Apply the Migration (Update the Database)**:
   After the migration is created, run the following command to apply the migration and update the database schema:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

6. **Verify the Database**:
   After running the above command, Entity Framework Core will apply the migration and update the database schema. You can verify this by inspecting the database directly, using your preferred database management tool.

### Command Summary:
1. **Add a migration**:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
   ```

2. **Update the database**:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

Make sure that your connection string in the `appsettings.json` or `Startup.cs` is correctly configured for the database you are updating.
